Passionate   about   building   AI-powered   applications,   secure   authentication   systems,   and   NLP   solutions.   Experienced   in   developing   projects   such   as   object   classification   using   Teachable   Machine,   two-   factor   authentication   systems,   real-time   language   translation   apps,   and   textual   entailment   for   NLP.   Seeking   opportunities   to   apply   my   technical   expertise   in   AI/ML,   natural   language   processing,   and   software   development   to   solve   real-world   problems.    Education  Vishwakarma   University,   Pune   2021   \u20132026   Bachelor   of   Technology   in   Information   Technology   GPA:   7.53/10    Technic al Skills  Programming Languages: Python Machine learning & AI: Google teachable machine, tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn Object classification, textual entailment in nlp, real-time predictions  Natural   language   processing   (nlp)  Frame works & Tools: TensorFlow (for machine learning models)  Projects   1.   Teachable   Machine   -   Object   Classification  Developed an object classification system using Google\u2019s Teachable Machine. Trained the model with user-uploaded  images   and   deployed   it   for   real-time   object   classification   using   TensorFlow   and   OpenCV,   providing   predictions   for   objects   shown   in   front   of   the   camera.    2.   Multilingual   Translator   App  Built a real-time language translation application using Google Translate API and Python. The app detects input language  automatically   and   provides   translations   for   multiple   languages,   enhancing   communication   and   language   learning.    3.   Textual   Entailment   Recognition   (NLP   Project)  Developed a Textual Entailment system using NLP to classify sentence pairs as entailment, contradiction, or neutral.  Used   the   SNLI   dataset   (570,000   pairs)   and   Transformer-based   embeddings   (e.g.,   Sentence-BERT)   with   an   MLP   classifier   for   efficient   semantic   processing   and   logical   relationship   detection."
