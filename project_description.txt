🔥 1. Resume Scoring + Visual Feedback (Recommended next)
📈 Give the user a score like 82/100 for a given job.

Show “Why this score?”

Show a progress bar, stars, badges, or “Fit Level: High/Medium/Low”

🔧 Tech:

Use same resume_skills and jd_skills

Add simple scoring logic (e.g. score = len(matched) / len(jd_skills) * 100)

Feed that to LLM for narrative explanation

Optional: Use Streamlit’s progress bar or emojis

💡 1. AI Project Recommendations (based on missing skills)
Give the user smart project ideas like:

“Build a Streamlit app using LangChain and FAISS”
“Deploy a BERT classifier with FastAPI and Docker”

🔧 LLM prompt based on missing_skills

🧠 2. Resume Improvement Suggestions (LLM + RAG)
Line-by-line suggestions for:

Bullet rewriting

Better verbs

Project descriptions

Could use:

RAG from resume text chunks

Templates

💬 3. Multi-Turn Memory Chat (Chat History)
Let user ask:

“What else should I add?”
“Now give me a project idea using FAISS”

And the coach remembers their resume + job + past Qs.

5. Compare Multiple Resumes for the Same JD
Upload 2–3 resumes → rank them → suggest improvements

🌐 6. Scrape JD From LinkedIn / Naukri URL
Paste a URL → auto-extract job text → match it instantly

Use BeautifulSoup, requests, or Playwright if needed.
